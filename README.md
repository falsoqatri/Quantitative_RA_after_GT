<h1>Quantitative Risk Assessment program - University of Essex</h1>



<h2>1.	Quantitative risk modelling approach</h2>
This code reads the asset values and threat levels from two text files (asset_values.txt and threat_levels.txt) that contain comma-separated values for each asset and threat. It then defines two functions (calculate_ale and interpret_ale) that work as in the previous example. Finally, it uses the read asset values and threat levels to calculate the annualized loss expectancy for a given asset and threat, and interprets the result based on the same scoring system as before.

<h2>2.	Internal supply chain risks include risk events caused by (Shahram, et al., 2013)</h2>

- <b>Disruptions of internal operations</b> 
- <b>Price Increases: Rising prices are caused by changes in supply or demand, currency instability, and customs tariffs.</b>
- <b>Shortages: These can arise from lacking a component, material, or part needed to produce a finished product</b> 
- <b>Supplier Relationships</b> 
- <b>Quality Failures: Quality failures occur when shipments of certain parts donâ€™t meet the specifications.</b> 
- <b>Delivery Failures: Carrier and logistical issues can result in late deliveries, damaged packages, or lost shipments.</b> 
- <b>Supply Shocks: Sudden worldwide or industry-wide drop in supply.</b> 

The calculation is done using the formula:  Expected Monetary Value (EMV) = Probability * Impact (Wagner & Shiraji , 2019)
<br />
 Where :
 <br />
 
Impact: the impact is the amount you will spend if a given identified risk occurs.
<br />
Probability: probability is the likelihood that any event will occur.

You can customize the text files to match your own data format, and adjust the code accordingly. Additionally, you can add error handling to handle cases where the files are missing or contain invalid data.
